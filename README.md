# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name

University of Guelph Course Parser and Search CLI Program

## Description

### Parser

The `parser.py` parses the `Section Selection Results WebAdvisor University of Guelph.html` file and creates a `courses.json` output file containing the universty of Guelph Course details in JSON format.

### Search

Requires `parser.py` to be run first and the `courses.json` to be available.
The `search.py` allowes users to search the `courses.json` file in a CLI using various options.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Requires Python3+

## Usage

### Parser

`python3 parser.py`

### Search

`python3 search.py`

User will then get a menu for 10 available search options. After choosing an option the user can enter the related search query to obtain a list of course detail results.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
